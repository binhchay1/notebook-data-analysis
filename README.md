Welcome to the **Online Retail EDA** project! 🚀 This is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project that dives into transactional data from a UK-based online retail store (2010-2011). Think of it as analyzing API logs to build a dashboard for an e-commerce web app. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we uncover insights about sales trends, customer behavior, and top products to drive business decisions.

## 📋 Project Overview
As a web developer, imagine you're tasked with analyzing user activity logs to optimize an online store. This project does just that with real-world data, answering questions like:
- 🛒 Which products sell the most?
- 📅 When are sales peaking?
- 👤 Who are the top customers?
- ⚠️ Are there any data anomalies?

The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook (`notebooks/eda.ipynb`), producing visualizations and actionable recommendations, like building a reporting feature for an admin panel.

## 🗃️ Dataset
The dataset is `Online Retail.xlsx` (available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00352/Online%20Retail.xlsx)), containing ~541k transactions. Columns include:
- **InvoiceNo**: Transaction ID (like a primary key).
- **StockCode**: Product ID (like SKU in an e-commerce DB).
- **Description**: Product name.
- **Quantity**: Units sold per transaction.
- **InvoiceDate**: Timestamp of the purchase (like `created_at`).
- **UnitPrice**: Price per unit.
- **CustomerID**: Unique customer identifier.
- **Country**: Where the transaction occurred.

📂 The dataset is placed in the `data/` folder but not tracked in Git due to its size (~25MB).

## 🛠️ Environment Requirements
To run this project, you need:
- **Python**: 3.12.3 (or compatible, e.g., 3.10+) 🐍
- **System**: Linux (e.g., Ubuntu), macOS, or Windows (WSL works great) 💻
- **Dependencies** (listed in `requirements.txt`):
  - `pandas>=2.2.0`: Data manipulation, like an ORM for tables.
  - `matplotlib>=3.8.0`: Plotting, like Chart.js for viz.
  - `seaborn>=0.13.0`: Prettier plots, like a CSS framework for charts.
  - `scipy>=1.14.0`: Statistical analysis, like a math library.
  - `ipykernel>=6.29.0`: Jupyter kernel for running notebooks.
  - `jupyter>=1.0.0`: Notebook server, like a dev server for analysis.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the project, like initializing a Node.js app with `npm install`.

1. **Clone the Repository** 📥:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-retail-eda.git
   cd online-retail-eda
   ```

2. **Download the Dataset** 📂:
   - Download `Online Retail.xlsx` from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00352/Online%20Retail.xlsx).
   - Place it in the `data/` folder.

3. **Create a Virtual Environment** 🏗️:
   To avoid conflicts (like the `externally-managed-environment` error on Debian/Ubuntu), use a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment** 🔄:
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   Your prompt should show `(venv)`.

5. **Install Dependencies** 📦:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Register Jupyter Kernel** 🔗:
   Link the virtual environment to Jupyter:
   ```bash
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=online-retail-eda --display-name="Online Retail EDA (Python 3.12.3)"
   ```

## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Start Jupyter Notebook** 🌐:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/eda.ipynb
   ```
   This opens a browser. Select `eda.ipynb` and choose the "Online Retail EDA (Python 3.12.3)" kernel from the top-right dropdown.

2. **Run All Cells** ▶️:
   - Click "Run All" in Jupyter or execute cells sequentially.
   - Outputs include data summaries, visualizations (histograms, bar/pie charts), and insights.

3. **Deactivate Environment** (when done) 🛑:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

## 📁 Project Structure
Like a web app repo, here's the layout:
```
online-retail-eda/
├── data/                  # Dataset (not tracked in Git) 📂
│   └── Online Retail.xlsx
├── notebooks/             # Jupyter notebooks, like src/ for code 📓
│   └── eda.ipynb          # Main analysis notebook
├── .gitignore             # Excludes data/, venv/, etc. 🚫
├── requirements.txt       # Dependencies, like package.json 📋
├── README.md             # You're reading it! 📖
└── LICENSE               # MIT License 📜
```

## 📈 Key Findings
Running `eda.ipynb` with the full dataset yields:
- **Total Transactions**: ~397k (after cleaning nulls, duplicates, negative values) 📊
- **Total Revenue**: ~£8.9M 💰
- **Average Order Value**: ~£22.39 💸
- **Top Product**: "WORLD WAR 2 GLIDERS ASSTD DESIGNS" (~54k units sold) 🛒
- **Top Country**: UK (~95% of revenue) 🌍
- **Busiest Month**: November 2011 (~£1.5M, holiday season) 🎄
- **Busiest Day**: Thursday (no Sunday sales, likely store policy) 📅
- **Outliers**: High quantities (e.g., 80k units) suggest wholesale orders ⚠️

## 💡 Recommendations
Like optimizing a web app based on analytics:
- **Inventory**: Stock up on top products like "JUMBO BAG RED RETROSPOT" 📦
- **Promotions**: Run campaigns in October-December (holiday peak) 🎁
- **Market Expansion**: Target non-UK markets (e.g., Netherlands) with localized SEO 🌐
- **Customer Loyalty**: Create programs for high-value customers (top `CustomerID` by revenue) 👥
- **Analytics**: Separate retail vs. wholesale orders for accurate reporting 📈

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
- **Error: `externally-managed-environment`** ⚠️: Ensure you're in the virtual environment (`source venv/bin/activate`). Check `which pip` points to `venv/bin/pip`.
- **Module Not Found** 🚫: Reinstall dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) or specific packages (`pip install numpy`).
- **Jupyter Not Launching** 🌐: Check port 8888 (`jupyter notebook --port=8889` if blocked).
- **Kernel Not Showing** 🔗: Re-register kernel (`python -m ipykernel install ...`).
