## Online Retail EDA
Welcome to the Online Retail EDA project! This is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project that dives into transactional data from a UK-based online retail store (2010-2011). Think of it as analyzing API logs to build a dashboard for an e-commerce web app. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we uncover insights about sales trends, customer behavior, and top products to drive business decisions.
# Project Overview
As a web developer, imagine you're tasked with analyzing user activity logs to optimize an online store. This project does just that with real-world data, answering questions like:
Which products sell the most?
When are sales peaking?
Who are the top customers?
Are there any data anomalies?

The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook (notebooks/eda.ipynb), producing visualizations and actionable recommendations, like building a reporting feature for an admin panel.
Dataset
The dataset is Online Retail.xlsx (available here), containing ~541k transactions. Columns include:

InvoiceNo: Transaction ID (like a primary key).
StockCode: Product ID (like SKU in an e-commerce DB).
Description: Product name.
Quantity: Units sold per transaction.
InvoiceDate: Timestamp of the purchase (like created_at).
UnitPrice: Price per unit.
CustomerID: Unique customer identifier.
Country: Where the transaction occurred.

The dataset is placed in the data/ folder but not tracked in Git due to its size (~25MB).
Environment Requirements
To run this project, you need:

Python: 3.12.3 (or compatible, e.g., 3.10+).
System: Linux (e.g., Ubuntu), macOS, or Windows (WSL works great).
Dependencies (listed in requirements.txt):
pandas>=2.2.0: Data manipulation, like an ORM for tables.
matplotlib>=3.8.0: Plotting, like Chart.js for viz.
seaborn>=0.13.0: Prettier plots, like a CSS framework for charts.
scipy>=1.14.0: Statistical analysis, like a math library.
ipykernel>=6.29.0: Jupyter kernel for running notebooks.
jupyter>=1.0.0: Notebook server, like a dev server for analysis.

# Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the project, like initializing a Node.js app with npm install.

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-retail-eda.git
cd online-retail-eda

Download the Dataset:

Download Online Retail.xlsx from UCI.
Place it in the data/ folder.

Create a Virtual Environment:To avoid conflicts (like the externally-managed-environment error on Debian/Ubuntu), use a virtual environment:
python3 -m venv venv

Activate the Virtual Environment:
# Linux/macOS
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

Your prompt should show (venv).

Install Dependencies:
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt


Register Jupyter Kernel:Link the virtual environment to Jupyter:
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=online-retail-eda --display-name="Online Retail EDA (Python 3.12.3)"



# How to Run

Start Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook notebooks/eda.ipynb

This opens a browser. Select eda.ipynb and choose the "Online Retail EDA (Python 3.12.3)" kernel from the top-right dropdown.

Run All Cells:

Click "Run All" in Jupyter or execute cells sequentially.
Outputs include data summaries, visualizations (histograms, bar/pie charts), and insights.

Deactivate Environment (when done):
deactivate

# Project Structure
Like a web app repo, here's the layout:
online-retail-eda/
├── data/                  # Dataset (not tracked in Git)
│   └── Online Retail.xlsx
├── notebooks/             # Jupyter notebooks, like src/ for code
│   └── eda.ipynb          # Main analysis notebook
├── .gitignore             # Excludes data/, venv/, etc.
├── requirements.txt       # Dependencies, like package.json
├── README.md             # You're reading it!
└── LICENSE               # MIT License

# Key Findings
Running eda.ipynb with the full dataset yields:

Total Transactions: ~397k (after cleaning nulls, duplicates, negative values).
Total Revenue: ~£8.9M.
Average Order Value: ~£22.39.
Top Product: "WORLD WAR 2 GLIDERS ASSTD DESIGNS" (~54k units sold).
Top Country: UK (~95% of revenue).
Busiest Month: November 2011 (~£1.5M, holiday season).
Busiest Day: Thursday (no Sunday sales, likely store policy).
Outliers: High quantities (e.g., 80k units) suggest wholesale orders.

# Recommendations
Like optimizing a web app based on analytics:

Inventory: Stock up on top products like "JUMBO BAG RED RETROSPOT".
Promotions: Run campaigns in October-December (holiday peak).
Market Expansion: Target non-UK markets (e.g., Netherlands) with localized SEO.
Customer Loyalty: Create programs for high-value customers (top CustomerID by revenue).
Analytics: Separate retail vs. wholesale orders for accurate reporting.

# Troubleshooting

Error: externally-managed-environment: Ensure you're in the virtual environment (source venv/bin/activate). Check which pip points to venv/bin/pip.
Module Not Found: Reinstall dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt) or specific packages (pip install numpy).
Jupyter Not Launching: Check port 8888 (jupyter notebook --port=8889 if blocked).
Kernel Not Showing: Re-register kernel (python -m ipykernel install ...).
